<h1>Velle</h1>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the repo for the new version of (mani)Velle, a tool supposed to be your coding buddy. Not in the AI-autocomplete way, rather by being a batteries-included toolkit meant to facilitate learning and using new technologies efficiently, as well as automating local and github scripts and files.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to handle local and online repositories more easily, combining and loading templates for your projects. You&rsquo;ll have access to all the velle scripts written officially and by the community to make your workflow more comfortable and less repetitive.</p>

<p>Finally, with the (WIP) discover mode, you&rsquo;ll be able to learn about new technologies by seeing examples, and get the best tooling from the get-go.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Fresh Install</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re new to velle, go grab the executable in <a href="https://github.com/HiiGHoVuTi/haskvelle/releases">the releases tab</a>, and execute the file from its folder.
You will see a shell like so:
<code>shell
Velle &gt;
</code>
Write the following:
<code>shell
Velle &gt; install whole-installation
</code>
If all goes well, the shell should guide you through the installation. Otherwise, please report the issue either in <a href="https://github.com/HiiGHoVuTi/haskvelle/issues">the issues tab</a>, or by <a href="https://maximecan.ml">contacting me</a>.</p>

<h3>Updating</h3>

<p>The logic is the same here, you can hop on <a href="https://github.com/HiiGHoVuTi/haskvelle/releases">the releases tab</a>, and grab the executable. However, you don&rsquo;t need to go through the installation procedure, you just need to move it to the same folder as the old executable, renaming it to <code>velle</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Please note that your outdated velle might not have the proper <code>main.cfg</code> file, please grab the default one in this repository&rsquo;s <code>public-files</code> folder if you have any issue.</p></blockquote>
