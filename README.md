# Velle

Here's the repo for the new version of (mani)Velle, a tool supposed to be your coding buddy. Not in the AI-autocomplete way, rather by being a batteries-included toolkit meant to facilitate learning and using new technologies efficiently, as well as automating local and github scripts and files.

You'll be able to handle local and online repositories more easily, combining and loading templates for your projects. You'll have access to all the velle scripts written officially and by the community to make your workflow more comfortable and less repetitive.

Finally, with the (WIP) discover mode, you'll be able to learn about new technologies by seeing examples, and get the best tooling from the get-go.

## Installation

### Fresh Install
If you're new to velle, go grab the executable in [the releases tab](https://github.com/HiiGHoVuTi/haskvelle/releases), and execute the file from its folder.
You will see a shell like so:
```shell
Velle >
```
Write the following:
```shell
Velle > install whole-installation
```
If all goes well, the shell should guide you through the installation. Otherwise, please report the issue either in [the issues tab](https://github.com/HiiGHoVuTi/haskvelle/issues), or by [contacting me](https://maximecan.ml).

### Updating

The logic is the same here, you can hop on [the releases tab](https://github.com/HiiGHoVuTi/haskvelle/releases), and grab the executable. However, you don't need to go through the installation procedure, you just need to move it to the same folder as the old executable, renaming it to `velle`. 
> Please note that your outdated velle might not have the proper `main.cfg` file, please grab the default one in this repository's `public-files` folder if you have any issue.
